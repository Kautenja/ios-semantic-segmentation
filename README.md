# semantic-segmentation-ios

An example of semantic segmentation on iOS using CoreML and Keras. Trained Tirmaisu 45 model comes from [here](https://github.com/Kautenja/neural-semantic-segmentation). A device with a camera is required, preferably a newer
one to maintain an acceptable framerate from the model.
